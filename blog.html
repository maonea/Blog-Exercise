            <h1>Best Modern Photographers of October 2020</h1>
            <p>What better way to improve your own work than to be inspired by others? I am absolutely convinced that
                discovering new portfolios on a regular basis helps educate your eye and have a better understanding of
                the possibilities that photography offers. Contemplating amazing images, in addition to being a
                pleasure, is a very good way to develop your "photographic eye", that little extra thing that will make
                your photos stand out. Each month we continue to discover incredible work from photographers that live
                and travel all around the world. Here is a selection of some incredible images of modern photographers
                for this month of October 2020 you can get some creative inspiration from.

            <h3>Reinout van den Bergh</h3>
            <img src="article_pic_2.jpg" class="photograph">
            <h4>The Netherlands</h4>
            <p>Reinout van den Bergh (Wageningen, the Netherlands, 1957) studied photography and audiovisual design at
                St. Joost School of Fine Art and Design in Breda, the Netherlands. Since 1982 he has been working from
                Breda as a photographer and audiovisual designer. In this capacity he has travelled throughout Europe,
                Africa, Asia, the Middle East, the USA and Latin America. He worked for various ethnographical museums
                and for Dutch development cooperation projects. His work has been exhibited in several museums in
                Eastern and Western Europe and Africa, and published in several books and other publications. The Miners
                from Beringen (2014) comprises a collection of photgraphs made in the Belgian mining community of
                Beringen during the 1980s. It was proclaimed as one of the best photobooks of the year by Dutch quality
                newspaper de Volkskrant. For the long-term project 'Factories' with fellow artist Huib Fens he visited
                industrial heritage everywhere in Europe. The 'Environment' project is a combination of visual art and
                photography, for which he cooperated with sculptor Gerhard Lentink, travelling in several European
                countries. As of 2006 Reinout van den Bergh has been curator of BredaPhoto. He also supervises students
                and graduates of its International Talent Program.</p>
